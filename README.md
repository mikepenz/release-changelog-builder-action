## Setup

### Configure the workflow

Specify the action as part of your GitHub actions workflow:

```yml
- name: "Build Changelog"
  id: build_changelog
  uses: mikepenz/release-changelog-builder-action@{latest-release}
```

## Full Sample üñ•Ô∏è

Below is a complete example showcasing how to define a build, which is executed when tagging the project. It consists of:
- Prepare tag, via the GITHUB_REF environment variable
- Build changelog, given the tag
- Create a release on GitHub - specifying body with a constructed changelog

> [!NOTE]  
> Pre v4 PRs will only show up in the changelog if assigned one of the default label categories "feature", "fix" or "test". Starting with v4 these PRs will be in the `Uncategorized` section.

| `mode`                    | Defines the mode used to retrieve the information. Available options: [`PR`, `COMMIT`, `HYBRID`]. Defaults to `PR`. Hybrid mode treats commits like pull requests.  Commit mode is a special configuration for projects which work without PRs. Uses commit messages as changelog. This mode looses access to information only available for PRs. Formerly set as `commitMode: true`, this setting is now deprecated and should be converted to `mode: "COMMIT"`. Note: the commit or hybrid modes are not fully supported. |

| `cache`                   | The file path to write/read the cache to/from.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

## Customization üñçÔ∏è

### Note

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> When running this action for non tags trigger the `toTag` will be automatically resolved using the latest tag as retrieved by the git API.

> [!NOTE]  
> The first release tag is a special case since there is no previous release the action can reference to. For this case, there are two options:
> 1. When checking out the source via `git` (E.g.: `actions/checkout`), the action will use the first commit.
> 2. Create an initial tag on the commit you want to begin a changelog from (for example `v0.0.1`).

> [!NOTE]  
> By default not specifying `fromTag` or `toTag` will resolve `toTag` from either the `ref` or alternatively fallback to the latest tag from the git API. `fromTag` is resolved by sorting tags using [semver](https://semver.org/). Check the [configuration](#configuration-specification) for alternatives.

> [!NOTE]  
> If you are behind a corporate HTTP proxy, you can set the `https_proxy` environment variable to the proxy URL. For reference, please see the Octokit [documentation](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.js/#proxy-servers-nodejs-only).

### Configuration

The action supports flexible and extensive configuration options to fine-tune it for the specific projects needs. To do so provide the configuration either directly to the step via `configurationJson` or as file via the `configuration`.

<details><summary><b>Configuration in .yml</b></summary>
<p>

```yml
- name: Build Changelog
  uses: mikepenz/release-changelog-builder-action@v5
  with:
    configurationJson: |
      {
        "template": "#{{CHANGELOG}}\n\n<details>\n<summary>Uncategorized</summary>\n\n#{{UNCATEGORIZED}}\n</details>",
        "categories": [
          {
              "title": "## üí¨ Other",
              "labels": ["other"]
          }
        ]
      }
```

</p>
</details>

<details><summary><b>Configuration as json file</b></summary>
<p>

```yml
- name: "Build Changelog"
  uses: mikepenz/release-changelog-builder-action@{latest-release}
  with:
    configuration: "configuration.json"
```

> [!WARNING]  
> It is required to have a `checkout` step prior to the changelog step if `configuration` is used, to allow the action to discover the configuration file. Use `configurationJson` as alternative.

</p>
</details>

> [!NOTE]  
> Defaults for the configuration can be found in the [configuration.ts](https://github.com/mikepenz/release-changelog-builder-action/blob/develop/src/configuration.ts)

> [!NOTE]  
> It is possible to provide the configuration as file and as json via the yml file. The order of config values used: `configurationJson` > `configuration` > `DefaultConfiguration`.

The configuration is a `JSON` in the following format. (The below showcases *example* configurations for all possible options. In most scenarios most of the settings will not be needed, and the defaults will be appropriate.)

```json
{
    "categories": [
      {
        "title": "## üöÄ Features",
        "labels": ["feature"]
      },
      {
        "title": "## üêõ Fixes",
        "labels": ["fix"]
      },
      {
        "key": "tests",
        "title": "## üß™ Tests",

### Regex Configuration

Since v5.x or newer, the regex configuration was unified to allow the same functionalities to be used for the various use-cases.
This applies to all configurations outlined in `Configuration Specification` and `Custom placeholders` that allow a regex object.

| <parent>.target      | The result pattern. The result text will be used as label. If empty, no label is created. (Usage depends on the `method` used for the regex).<br/><br/>Javascript methods (`replace`, `replaceAll`, `match`) define the regex in JavaScript format (e.g. double backslash to escape a dot \\.). For example to include all matching tags and exclude the rest, use negative lookahead to exclude tags. For example, api.* will only include tags starting with "api", ^(?!alpha).* will exclude all tags starting with "alpha". |
| <parent>.method      | The extraction method used. Defaults to: `replace`. Alternative values: `replaceAll`, `match`. These methods specified references the JavaScript String method.

  }
}
```

> [!WARNING]  
> Usages of `\` in the json have to be escaped. E.g. `\` becomes `\\`.

### Custom placeholders

Starting with v3.2.0 the action provides a feature of defining `CUSTOM_PLACEHOLDERS`.

Custom placeholders allow to extract values from any existing placeholder and insert them into the target template.

<details><summary><b>Example</b></summary>
<p>

Custom placeholders can be defined via the `configuration.json` as `custom_placeholders`. See the below example json:

```json
{
  "template": "**Epics**\n#{{EPIC[*]}}\n\n#{{CHANGELOG}}",
  "pr_template": "- #{{TITLE}} - #{{URL}} #{{EPIC}}",
  "custom_placeholders": [
    {
      "name": "EPIC",
      "source": "BODY",
      "transformer": {
        "pattern": "[\\S\\s]*?(https:\\/\\/corp\\.atlassian\\.net\\/browse\\/EPIC-.{2,4})[\\S\\s]*",
        "target": "- $1"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

This example will look for JIRA tickets in the EPIC project, and extract all of these tickets. The exciting part for that case is, that the ticket is PR-bound but can be used in the global TEMPLATE, but equally also in the PR template. This is unique for CUSTOM PLACEHOLDERS as standard placeholders do not offer this functionality.

| **Input**                                   | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| custom_placeholders                         | An array of `Placeholder` specifications, offering a flexible API to extract custom placeholders from existing placeholders.                                                                        |
| custom_placeholders.name                    | The name of the custom placeholder. Will be used within the template.                                                                                                                               |
| custom_placeholders.source                  | The source PLACEHOLDER, requires to be one of the existing Template or PR Template placeholders.                                                                                                    |
| custom_placeholders.transformer.{\<REGEX\>} | The transformer specification used to extract the value from the original source PLACEHOLDER. Please see the documentation related to [Regex Configuration](#regex-configuration) for more details. |

A placeholder with the name as `CUSTOM_PLACEHOLDER` can be used as `#{{CUSTOM_PLACEHOLDER}}` in the target template.
By default the same restriction applies as for PR vs. template placeholder. E.g. a global placeholder can only be used in the global template (and not in the PR template).

Custom placeholders offer one new feature, though. PR-related placeholders can be used in the global template via the following syntax:

- `CUSTOM_PLACEHOLDER[*]` - Will join all found values and insert them at the given location in the global template
- `CUSTOM_PLACEHOLDER[0]` / `CUSTOM_PLACEHOLDER[index]` - Will insert the first found value (item at index) into the global template

### Gitea support üß™

Starting with v4.1.0 the action is also compatible with [gitea](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea).

> [!WARNING]  
> The API from gitea does not allow to retrieve the `diff` via its API, requiring the repo to be checked out

The API for gitea is equal to the one from GitHub, however it requires the `platform` to be specified.

```yml
- name: Build Changelog
  uses: https://github.com/mikepenz/release-changelog-builder-action@v5
  with:
    platform: "gitea" # gitea or GitHub, default is GitHub
    configuration: "configuration.json"
  env:
    token: ${{ secrets.GITEA_TOKEN }}
```

## Contribute üß¨

```bash
# Install the dependencies
$ npm install

# Verify lint is happy
$ npm run lint -- --fix

# Build the typescript and package it for distribution
$ npm run build && npm run package

# Run the tests, use to debug, and test it out
$ npm test
```

It's suggested to export the token to your path before running the tests so that API calls can be done to GitHub.

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_personal_github_pat
```

## Local Testing üß™

This GitHub action is fully developed in Typescript and can be run locally via `npm` or right from the browser using `GitHub Codespace`.

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/mikepenz/release-changelog-builder-action)

Doing so is a great way to test the action and/or your custom configurations locally, without the need to push and re-run GitHub actions over and over again.

To run locally, or to access private repositories (GitHub Codespaces has automatic access to public repos with the default token), you will require to provide a valid `GITHUB_TOKEN` with read-only permissions to access the repositories you want to run this action towards. (See more details in [Token Permission](#Token-Permission))

To test your own configuration and use-case, the project contains a [\_\_tests\_\_/demo/demo.test.ts](https://github.com/mikepenz/release-changelog-builder-action/blob/develop/__tests__/demo/demo.test.ts) file, modify this one to your needs. (e.g., change repo, change token, change settings, ...), and then run it via:

```bash
npm test -- demo.test.ts
```

<details><summary><b>Debugging with Breakpoints</b></summary>
<p>

One major benefit of setting up a custom test is that it will allow you to use JavaScripts full debugging support, including the option of breakpoints via (for example) Visual Code.

From GitHub codespaces, open the terminal panel -> Click the small arrow down beside `+` and pick `JavaScript Debug Terminal` (make sure to export the token again). Now execute the test with this terminal. (This is very similar to local Visual Code environments).

</p>
</details>

<details><summary><b>Run common tests</b></summary>
<p>

To run the common tests of the action, you require to export a valid GitHub token.

```
# Export the token in the CLI you use to execute.
export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_read_only_github_token
```

Afterwards it is possible to run any test included in the project:

```bash
npm test -- main.test.ts # modify the file name to run other testcases
```

</p>
</details>

## Token Permission

Permissions depend on the specific use-case, however this action only requires `read-only` permissions as it will not make modifications to the repository.

### GitHub actions

Depending on the given environment it may be required to define teh token scope for GitHub actions to `read` for `contents` and `pull-requests`.

```
permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: read
```

[GitHub Actions token scope](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/assigning-permissions-to-jobs#defining-access-for-the-github_token-scopes).

### `Fine-grained personal access tokens`

For `Fine-grained personal access tokens` this means:

- `read` for [Pull requests](https://github.com/mikepenz/release-changelog-builder-action/blob/develop/pr-collector/src/pullRequests.ts#L124)
  - Covered by the `pull-requests` scope
- `read` for [Commits](https://github.com/mikepenz/release-changelog-builder-action/blob/develop/pr-collector/src/commits.ts#L54)
  - Covered by the `contents` scope
- `read` for [Tags](https://github.com/mikepenz/release-changelog-builder-action/blob/develop/pr-collector/src/tags.ts#L32) (if not available the `from` and `to` refs have to be provided)
  - Covered by the `contents` scope
- `read` to [list reviews](https://github.com/mikepenz/release-changelog-builder-action/blob/develop/pr-collector/src/pullRequests.ts#L186)
  - Covered by the `contents` scope

### Classic tokens

For Classic tokens you only have to create the token without special permissions.
